Summary : 

-Software engineering provides knowledge, processes, practices and
tools for all the phases in software development lifecycle (SDLC)

-Software requirements describe the functionalities of the software

-Software design describes system structure: modules
and interactions

-Software constructions involves coding, debugging, unit testing,
code reviews and integration (including continuous integration)

-The QA engineering process ensures the software works as intended
(it is bug free), mostly through testing (manual and automated)

-Software deployment ships the software to customers: dev env ➞
test environment ➞ staging environment ➞ production
environment
