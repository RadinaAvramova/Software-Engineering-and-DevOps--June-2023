Summary :

-Branch == a new separate version of the main repository

-Build your branching strategy from these three main concepts
  
  ▪ Use branches for all new features and bug fixes
  
  ▪ Merge feature branches into the main branch using pull requests
  
  ▪ Keep a high quality, up-to-date main branch

-Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub
